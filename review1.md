In this blog, the writers succinctly give an overview of their chosen paper on an interesting way of image generation, namely using Visual AutoRegressive Modeling(VAR). AutoRegressive models are the backbone of modern LLMs and so generally associated with fields of text generation, classification, prediction - Natural Language Processing(NLP) in short. However, this blog introduces us to the idea of generating excellent images using AutoRegressive models. 
 
The blog is well structured. Giving us a short introduction to the realm of Generative Computer Vision, it quickly explains using the paper how till now, AutoRegressive models have failed to reach the conventional powerhouses of image generation: diffusion models and Generative Adversarial Networks(GAN). Then it delves inside the paper's contribution, the VAR model and its working principals. Using appropriate figures from the papers, the blog has explained the basic flow of VAR training and inference. Then the blog presents the results of the paper, showcasing how it has reached the SOTA in many image generation tasks and benchmarks. The strength of the paper is its graphical explanations for the high performing VAR model and the blog follows suit, using figures, tables judiciously. 
 
There could be some minor changes or brush ups. The Vector Quantized Variable AutoEncoder(VQVAE) is essential for the VAR training. Perhaps it could be explained a bit more, for those new to the field of AutoRegressive models or Computer Vision. The long result tables could be truncated to showcase the paper's results. Overall, these are minor setbacks to an otherwise excellent blog. To conclude, this is an excellent blog on a fascinating paper, explaining the VAR model, perhaps heralding a new era in image generation using AutoRegressive models.
