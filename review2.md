<h3><b><p align="center"> <a href="https://shitdroid.github.io/posts/agile-review/">From Tokens to Mastery: How AGILE is Redefining AI Decision-Making</a></p></b></h3>
 
We have all seen those little chat icons in modern websites, the ubiquitous AI chatbots that are supposed to help users finding answers to their specific problems. However, often these are just preset messages or at best a generic LLM model, making no real decisions/responses. In this nice blog, the writers introduce us to a new idea of AI decision making paradigm: AGILE, one that promises to be an actual intelligent helper using LLMs.
 
The blog is very well structured, presenting the paper step by step. First we are shown how an intelligent decision making AI would use different steps and components to come up with a solution to a problem/query. Then the blog introduces the paper's contribution, that is the AGILE framework. It is composed of multiple parts including the policy making LLM, the memory and the database, all of which are orchestrated by the executor. Crucially there is a human in the loop, as AGILE can seek expert advice for questions it cannot satisfactorily answer. From here, the blog moves on to the testing of AGILE frameworks in multiple datasets and benchmarks. The well performing results of AGILE are shown and thus the importance of AGILE is established. 
 
There could be some tiny brush ups in the blog as we read on. The AGILE framework's training and testing methodologies could be explained a bit more, though these are already in the addendum of the paper and so the blog might be following the main paper's structure. Also, the results section might use some of the values/tables to give more strong basis to the claims. However, these are minor changes to an otherwise well-written, excellently structured and designed blog on a very useful paper advancing the use of LLMs.
